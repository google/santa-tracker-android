## Building the app

First up, Santa Tracker is powered by [Firebase][firebase], so you'll need to enable it
on your Google account over at the [Firebase console][fire-console]. Once you're in the
console, follow these steps:

 * Create a new project
 * Add Firebase to your Android app
  * Package name: `com.google.android.apps.santatracker.debug`
  * Debug signing certificate can be blank, or follow the instructions in the
    tooltip to find yours.
 * Save the `google-services.json` file to the `santa-tracker/` directory

Now you should be able to plug your phone in (or fire up an emulator) and run:

    ./gradlew santa-tracker:installDebug

Alternatively, import the source code into Android Studio (File, Import Project).

Note: You'll need Android SDK version 24, build tools 24.0.0, and the Android Support Library to
compile the project. If you're unsure about this, use Android Studio and tick the appropriate boxes
in the SDK Manager.
